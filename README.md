# Recipe Finder

## Description
- This application allows users to enter any food and see the ingredients or recipe for it.
  
- My motivation for this project was to learn how to work with an API and how API calls work.
  
- I built this project because I personally love food. Seeing my passion for food come to life was inspiring.
  
- This application is very simple and user-friendly. This makes it easy for people to find and discover meals while also showing them how to make it! A one-stop shop for recipes.
